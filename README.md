# Cells

A small game / model, that emulates a life of different cell colonies.
Rules:
- Every cell has a max lifetime
- Cell need to eat
- After eating enough, the cell splits
- Food base has limited capacity, which motivates cells to move to new food bases
- If the cell sees the other colony's cell, it is moving forward and attacking it
- When too hungry, the cell goes to a closest foodbase
